In this post, we will use plpython function to execute a cypher query.

Like you used in PostgreSQL, you can simply use cypher syntaxes with `plpy.execute`.

{% highlight python %}
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cypher_test()
RETURNS void
AS $$
#Python source code starts
#Assume that you have a vertex with label test and property text
records = plpy.execute("MATCH (a:test) RETURN a.text AS sample")

plpy.info(records[0]['sample'])
#Python source code ends
$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu
#=> prints 'hello' as a result 
{% endhighlight %}

- `plpy.execute` executes given queries and returns the result of query.
- `plpy.info` can print anything that happens in your plpython script.
